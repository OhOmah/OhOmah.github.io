My **first ever data science project..**

It feels like your first love, something you can never forget but wish you knew more when you came into it. But unlike your first love, you can actually do that. Especially since then I've done more with this data and built a model on top of it! 

This project was from my first ever month in Lambda School, when the profession of Data Science was still an abstract idea to me. Something I didn't even have a full understanding of yet. To be honest, I still don't have a full understanding of what makes a data scientist, I think most Data Scientists don't either. 

That being said, this project was pretty abstract, but quickly humbled me as I took the time to look at the dataset one more time. Thinking about how easy it sounds to visualize and clean data, something that an intern would do! But there is a reason why there's a field of data scientists that just clean, visualize and explain data to businesses. 

Today I'm challenging myself, taking the iRacing dataset one more time and seeing what kind of results I can come up with, already looking back at my first attempt there were some clear flaws stemming all the way to the very first step. My question. I asked a very simple question that easily could've been answered with logic, ** Would more time spent in iRacing mean you'd be in a higher skill bracket?** 

We're going to change that question and see what we can answer with the data. Instead of asking if putting time into the simulator results into skill, I want to see which region of the world has the most skilled racers. 

I quickly realized that I'm going to have to completely changed how I approached handling and working with my data. from the ground up I need to engineer new features and remove different kinds if I want to build any kind of new model. 

Let's start with some visualizations:
