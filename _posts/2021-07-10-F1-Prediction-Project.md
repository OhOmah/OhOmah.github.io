## Introduction
Hey Adam, while you were talking about the engine’s temp going over 240 degs, I thought that it’d be really cool if you put some kindof thermal cam in the engine bay? I know stuff gets real hot and all we’d not see sh*t, but what if the ratios are lowered so we can see how the engine and the components react to heat cycling?Hey Adam, while you were talking about the engine’s temp going over 240 degs, I thought that it’d be really cool if you put some kindof thermal cam in the engine bay?
