## Introduction
I finally finished Lambda School, got my data science & machine learning certification and landed my very first internship! The only thing left is to start my first project to explore subjects that I either brushed across when studying or never had the chance to explore. So, I present to everyone, My F1 Race Predictor. 

This is a project that takes the current driver lineup and will predict who will win any given race based on their race history. Formula One is a data driven sport, since the 80s teams have been grabbing data from their cars to continuously chase even the smallest gains to get the edge over their opponents. I will be grabbing data from the Ergast F1 API (http://ergast.com/mrd/) ***Don’t forget to actually link this*** to train my machine learning model. This review of this project will be a summarized version and the full write up will be found ***here***. 

## Grabbing Data & Data Analysis
Hey Adam, while you were talking about the engine’s temp going over 240 degs, I thought that it’d be really cool if you put some kindof thermal cam in the engine bay? I know stuff gets real hot and all we’d not see sh*t, but what if the ratios are lowered so we can see how the engine and the components react to heat cycling?Hey Adam, while you were talking about the engine’s temp going over 240 degs, I thought that it’d be really cool if you put some kindof thermal cam in the engine bay?
