I wish I wrote about this eariler, my first ever data science project..

It feels like your first love, something you can never forget but wish you knew more when you came into it. But unlike your first love, you can actually do that. Especially since then I've done more with this data and built a model on top of it! 

This project was from my first ever month in Lambda School, when the profession of Data Science was still an abstract idea to me. Something I didn't even have a full understanding of yet. That month we've learned the absolute basics, as expected.
