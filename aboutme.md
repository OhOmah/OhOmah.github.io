### My story

My career started when I was a professional video editor for YouTubers and small tv commercials when I was 17 years old and continued that career path up until I was 22. After the passing of my father, I set the video editing business aside and decided to inherit his business as it was a whole new challenge for me to conquer. I began to own and operate Autoshine Detail Supply, a automotive detailing product manufacturer and distributor. I began to study chemistry to enchance old formulas and business to help grow new relationships and build apon old relationships with existing customers. Unfortunatlly at the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic, I could not have the business remain open with orders in an all time low. I decided to close the business down and leave my father's legacy behind to build my own. As of now I'm currently a Lambda School student studying data science.
